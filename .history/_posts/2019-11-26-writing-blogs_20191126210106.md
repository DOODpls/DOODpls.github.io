# Those sharp angles
I didn't get all the fuss about until i watched this video.. First of all, i'm not gonna criticize them because the truck looks like a polygon, Infact, it looks cool to me, it looks very industrial, it's very ***FAST*** and the range is awesome. We know that the glass broke when his employee trew onto it, and Elon Musk commented something about that on twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time …</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198772995021406209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As he said on the unvaiing, "There's a room for improvement" and i want to see some improvement in the design, yes, I said that i liked it, but please add some curves into it, so it'll be more aerodynamic. And it looks like you can use it for zombie apocalypes.
