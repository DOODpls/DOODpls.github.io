# How do i feel about Jekyll...
Going into a new technology (for me) like jekyll feels great, because you learn new things.. At first is kinda a mess to me, but if you get the hang of it, it's kinda intuitive, its like a blocks, blocks of code that you you just stack on layouts folder. And having to choose a theme is good and there's a ton to choose from. Plugins are great, it'll make your coding easier, like this one that im using.. its a [Jekyll admin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin) that you can edit your post with GUI and it has a real-time preview on how your post looks.

**Overall**, i really enjoy doing it, this first project is kinda mess, but ill improve it in the **future**.
