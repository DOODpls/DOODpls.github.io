<p>Going into a new technology (for me) like jekyll feels great, because you learn new things.. At first is kinda a mess to me, but if you get the hang of it, itâ€™s kinda intuitive, its like a blocks, blocks of code that you you just stack on layouts folder. And having to choose a theme is good and thereâ€™s a ton to choose from. Plugins are great, itâ€™ll make your coding easier, like this one that im using.. its a <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin">Jekyll admin</a> that you can edit your post with GUI and it has a real-time preview on how your post looks.</p>
