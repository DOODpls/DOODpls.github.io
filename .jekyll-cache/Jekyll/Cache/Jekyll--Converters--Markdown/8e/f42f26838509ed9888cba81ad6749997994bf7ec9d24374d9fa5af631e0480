<p>I didnâ€™t get all the fuss about until i watched this video.. First of all, iâ€™m not gonna criticize them because the truck looks like a polygon, Infact, it looks cool to me, it looks very industrial, itâ€™s very <strong><em>FAST</em></strong> and the range is awesome. We know that the glass broke when his employee trew onto it, and Elon Musk commented something about that on twitter:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didnâ€™t bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time â€¦</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198772995021406209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p>As he said on the unvaiing, â€œThereâ€™s a room for improvementâ€ and i want to see some improvement in the design, yes, I said that i liked it, but please add some curves into it, so itâ€™ll be more aerodynamic. And it looks like you can use it for zombie apocalypes.</p>
