Buying monitors nowadays is very easy and **cheap**, but finding a good and **cheap** is hard. That's why i  went to amazon and bought an entry level ultrawide monitor called LG 25UM58-P 25".

for me it's very helpful as a programmer, you can put application side by side without sacrificing that much space. And it's also good for media consumption because of its wide aspectratio of 21:9 which is very cinematic.
<br/>
Playing FPS games is much easier because you have a wider field of view, so you can see enemies from the corner of your screen. Racing games looks fantastic also, having cinematic view of the road and your car is beautiful.
<br/>
You can also overlock the refresh rate to 75hz (which is not alot this day) but its a good addition for added smoothness on your gameplay.
<br/>
Overall, I'm pretty happy for it, might buy a larger one hehehhe.
